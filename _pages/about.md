This is Zhi Ling ("Zhi" sounds the same as Gee). I am a research assistant from Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore. My advisor is [Dr. Swapnil Mishra](https://s-mishra.github.io/). I'm broadly interested in machine learning and public health. I am also interested in developing general Bayesian methods for biostatistical applications.

<!-- Before joining NUS, I acquired my M.Sc. with distinction at Imperial College London. In my graduation thesis, I have worked with [Dr. Oliver Ratmann](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/oliver.ratmann05) within the [Machine Learning & Global Health Network](https://mlgh.net/). We focused on developing Bayesian models to infer social contact dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic.  -->

In my spare time, I am deeply engaged in to the digital compilation and analysis of ancient Chinese books. This includes a particular focus on traditional Chinese medicine and ancient Chinese literature. I am currently leading a major project on the phonetic notation of Chinese philosophical classics (Typst, RustPython), possibly the largest of its kind to date. This project is in collaboration with my friends from Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and aims to promote cultural education and dissemination. See [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/两都赋.pdf) for an example.
